# Build A Fabric Real-Time Intelligence Solution in a Day
### Overall Estimated Duration: 4 Hours
## Overview

In this lab, you will explore Real-Time Intelligence, create a Fabric Workspace, and set up an Eventhouse for event-driven data. You will enable OneLake Availability, create an Eventstream, and run a Data Generator Notebook to simulate streaming events. Additionally, you will set up a Lakehouse, upload reference data, access Eventhouse data, build a KQL Database schema, and develop a Real-Time Dashboard with auto-refresh. Finally, you will use Data Activator to automate real-time actions.

## Objectives

Understand how to leverage **Microsoft Fabric** for real-time data processing, analytics, and automation. By the end of this lab, you will have knowledge of:  

- **Setting Up a Fabric Workspace and Eventhouse:** Create a **Fabric Workspace** for project collaboration and set up an **Eventhouse** to efficiently store and process event-driven data.  
- **Integrating Data with OneLake and Eventstream:** Enable **OneLake Availability** for seamless data integration and create a **new Eventstream**, defining its topology to manage real-time data ingestion.  
- **Simulating and Processing Streaming Data:** Import and run a **Data Generator Notebook** to simulate streaming events, then define the **Eventstream topology** for structured data flow.  
- **Building a Lakehouse for Data Storage and Processing:** Set up a **Lakehouse**, upload reference data files, and create **Delta tables** for efficient data storage and processing.  
- **Querying and Structuring Data with KQL:** Access **Eventhouse data** from the Lakehouse and build a **KQL Database schema** to structure and query real-time data effectively.  
- **Creating Real-Time Dashboards and Automating Insights:** Develop a **Real-Time Dashboard**, enable **auto-refresh**, and use **Data Activator** to automate actions based on real-time events.  

## Pre-requisites

Participants should have:  

- **Basic understanding of Microsoft Fabric:** Familiarity with Fabric’s data processing, storage, and analytics capabilities.  
- **Familiarity with real-time data processing concepts:** Understanding of streaming data, event-driven architectures, and analytics workflows.  

## Architecture

In this lab, you will build a Real-Time Intelligence Solution in Microsoft Fabric to analyze web traffic and consumer behavior for an e-commerce website. Using clickstream data, you will leverage Fabric Real-Time Intelligence to track visitor interactions and predict sales trends. The workflow includes streaming events into Fabric Eventhouse via Eventstream, performing real-time data transformations using Kusto Query Language (KQL), and utilizing OneLake availability to seamlessly access data through the Lakehouse. Additionally, you will create real-time visualizations with Fabric Real-Time Dashboards and implement Data Activator Reflex actions to automate alerts and responses based on streaming data.

## Explanation of Components

The architecture for this lab involves the following key components:

- **Python Notebook:** Generates and ingests streaming data into the system.  
- **Eventstream:** Acts as a streaming data pipeline, ingesting events from the Notebook into **Eventhouse**.  
- **Eventhouse:** A real-time analytics store that processes and structures streaming data for further use.  
- **Lakehouse:** Serves as a storage layer for structured and unstructured data, accessible via shortcuts from **Eventhouse**.  
- **Real-Time Dashboard:** Visualizes real-time data from **Eventhouse** for monitoring and insights.  
- **Data Activator:** Automates responses and alerts based on real-time streaming data.
